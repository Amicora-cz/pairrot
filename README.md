# Pairrot

Pairrot matches incoming bank payments to expected payments and reports the results to its customers. It runs as a single ASP.NET Core application that serves an API and also runs background processing. Its first customer is [NaLekci](https://nalekci.cz).

Implemented so far:

- **Feature 1: tenants, subtenants, and API access** ([spec](docs/features/001-tenants.md))
- **Feature 2: user login, sessions, and API key management** ([spec](docs/features/002-user-login-and-sessions.md))
- **Feature 3: bank configuration and an inbound email address** ([spec](docs/features/003-bank-configuration-and-inbound-address.md)), with a local stub instead of Resend
- **Feature 4: payment QR generation** ([spec](docs/features/004-payment-qr-generation.md)): Czech QR Platba (SPAYD) payloads and PNG codes for saved accounts
- **Feature 5: expected payments** ([spec](docs/features/005-expected-payments.md)): saved payment requests with a reservation reference, frozen payment instructions, edits, and cancellation

The target architecture is described in [docs/architektura.md](docs/architektura.md) (in Czech).

Designed next, not yet implemented:

- [Feature 006: inbound email reception through Resend](docs/features/006-inbound-email-reception.md)
- [Feature 007: Česká spořitelna messages to incoming transactions](docs/features/007-bank-message-parsing.md)

## Tech stack

## Getting started

Prerequisites: .NET SDK 10 (see `global.json`), Docker, and Node.js 20+ for the SPA.

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL. It listens on localhost:5433 and keeps its data in a Docker volume.
docker compose up -d

# 2. Restore local tools (dotnet-ef).
dotnet tool restore

# 3. Apply migrations, create the nalekci.cz root tenant and its first administrator.
#    The tenant key and management key are printed once. Store them.
#    The administrator's password is prompted (not echoed, never logged).
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- setup --admin-email you@example.com

# 4. Run the API over HTTPS (https://localhost:7017, also http://localhost:5034).
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Api --launch-profile https
```

API-key clients (Feature 1) can use plain HTTP on port 5034. Browser sessions need HTTPS because the session cookie is `Secure`.

To change the database name, credentials, or port, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. If you change them, also update `ConnectionStrings:Pairrot` in `appsettings.Development.json`.

Example requests are in [src/Pairrot.Api/Pairrot.Api.http](src/Pairrot.Api/Pairrot.Api.http).

### Local SPA

```bash
cd web
npm install
dotnet dev-certs https --trust   # once per machine, so the browser trusts localhost
npm run cert                     # exports the ASP.NET Core dev certificate to web/.cert (git-ignored)
npm run dev                      # https://localhost:5173
```

Sign in with the administrator created by `setup` or `users create`. Vite proxies `/v1/...` to `https://localhost:7017`, so the SPA and the API share one origin; set `PAIRROT_API_URL` to proxy elsewhere. The SPA keeps the antiforgery token and one-time key secrets in memory only, never in browser storage.

## Configuration

The database connection is read from `ConnectionStrings:Pairrot` (environment variable: `ConnectionStrings__Pairrot`). Local development values are in `appsettings.Development.json`. To use Neon or any other PostgreSQL, set the environment variable; no code changes are needed:

```bash
ConnectionStrings__Pairrot="Host=<neon-host>;Database=pairrot;Username=<user>;Password=<password>;SSL Mode=Require"
```

Do not commit real credentials.

Browser sign-in settings are application configuration in the `Auth` section (for example `Auth__SessionIdleTimeout`):

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionIdleTimeout` | `00:30:00` | A session ends after this long without user activity. Requests with `X-Pairrot-Background: true` (polling) do not count as activity. |
| `SessionAbsoluteTimeout` | `08:00:00` | A session ends this long after login, even if the user stays active. |
| `LockoutMaxFailedAttempts`, `LockoutDuration` | `5`, `00:05:00` | Temporary account lockout after repeated wrong passwords. |
| `LoginRateLimitPermits`, `LoginRateLimitWindow` | `10`, `00:01:00` | Login requests allowed per client IP address and window; excess requests get `429`. |
| `PasswordMinLength` | `12` | Minimum password length. |

Notification addresses for bank connections come from the `InboundEmail` section. Only the local stub exists so far:

| Setting | Value in `appsettings.json` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Provider` | `stub` | The only supported value. The stub generates addresses; it receives no email and makes no network call. |
| `Domain` | `in.pairrot.test` | Domain of generated addresses. It must be a reserved test domain (`.test`, `.example`, `.invalid`, `.localhost`); the API does not start otherwise. |

Cookie-protection (Data Protection) keys are stored in the `data_protection_keys` table, so sessions survive restarts and work across instances that share the database.

## API overview

JSON uses snake_case fields. There are two ways to authenticate:

- **API keys** for integrations: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, format `prt_<key-id>_<secret>`. Pairrot stores only a SHA-256 hash of the secret, so a key's secret is shown only when the key is created.
- **Browser sessions** for people: email and password, then an `HttpOnly` cookie that identifies a server-side session row in PostgreSQL. The session, the user, and the membership are re-checked on every request.

If an `Authorization` header is present, only the key is checked; an invalid key never falls back to the cookie.

| Caller | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant key, or a session with the tenant selected | `GET /v1/tenant`, `GET/PATCH /v1/tenant/configuration`, `GET/POST /v1/tenant/bank-connections`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/tenant/bank-connections/{id}`, `POST /v1/tenant/bank-connections/{id}/inbound-address`, `POST /v1/tenant/bank-connections/{id}/payment-qr` and `.../payment-qr.png`, `GET/POST /v1/tenant/payment-requests`, `GET/PATCH /v1/tenant/payment-requests/{id}`, `POST .../{id}/cancel`, `GET .../{id}/payment-instructions` and `.../{id}/qr.png` |
| Management key, or a session of a root administrator with `can_create_subtenants` | `POST/GET /v1/subtenants`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/subtenants/{id}`, `GET/POST /v1/subtenants/{id}/api-keys`, `DELETE /v1/subtenants/{id}/api-keys/{keyId}`, and the same bank connection and payment request routes under `/v1/subtenants/{id}/bank-connections` and `/v1/subtenants/{id}/payment-requests` |
| Session only | `GET/POST /v1/tenant/api-keys`, `DELETE /v1/tenant/api-keys/{id}`, `GET /v1/tenant/audit-events`, `GET /v1/subtenants/{id}/audit-events` |
| Sign-in and session | `GET /v1/auth/antiforgery`, `POST /v1/auth/login`, `GET /v1/auth/session`, `POST /v1/auth/select-tenant`, `POST /v1/auth/logout`, `POST /v1/auth/logout-all`, `POST /v1/auth/change-password` |

Browser requests carry two extra headers:

- `X-XSRF-TOKEN` is required on login and on every cookie-authenticated `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. Get it from `GET /v1/auth/antiforgery`, and get a new one after login and after logout.
- `X-Pairrot-Tenant-Id` is the tenant the page is showing. It is required on tenant-scoped browser requests. If the session has switched to another tenant, for example in another tab, the request fails with `409 tenant_context_changed` instead of acting on the wrong tenant.

Errors use the format `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}` with the statuses 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 412, 428, and 429. Validation errors about one request field also include `"field"`, so a form can show the error next to that input. Unauthenticated browser requests get a `401` JSON response, never a redirect. A resource that exists but belongs to another tenant returns the same 404 as an unknown identifier. The full contracts are in the specs for [Feature 1](docs/features/001-tenants.md#4-api-contract), [Feature 2](docs/features/002-user-login-and-sessions.md#6-api-additions), [Feature 3](docs/features/003-bank-configuration-and-inbound-address.md#6-api-additions-and-permissions), [Feature 4](docs/features/004-payment-qr-generation.md#5-api-additions), and [Feature 5](docs/features/005-expected-payments.md#5-api).

### Bank connections

A bank connection is a Czech CZK account that belongs to one tenant for its whole life. Root tenants and subtenants use the same endpoints. Create one with `account_number` (`[prefix-]number/bank_code`, e.g. `19-2000145399/0800`), `iban`, or both, plus an optional `label`. The API checks the format and the check digits (CNB mod-11 and IBAN mod-97) and returns both forms. This does not prove that the account exists or who owns it.

- The IBAN is the account's identity. One account can belong to only one connection in the whole system, archived ones included. Another tenant's account gets a generic `409 account_unavailable`.
- Only the label can be changed. `DELETE` archives a connection and keeps its details and address.
- `POST .../inbound-address` assigns an address such as `p_<random>@in.pairrot.test` once. Retries and concurrent requests return the same address. `address_status` is only ever `not_created` or `stub_created`. No bank email is received yet, so do not configure these addresses in internet banking.
- A parent can inspect a suspended child's connections but cannot change them. A deleted child's connections are kept read-only for history.

### Payment QR codes

`POST .../bank-connections/{id}/payment-qr` returns payment data and a [QR Platba](https://qr-platba.cz/pro-vyvojare/specifikace-formatu/) (SPAYD) payload for an active connection. `POST .../payment-qr.png` returns the same payload as a PNG (`image/png`, download filename, `Cache-Control: no-store`). Both accept the same body and return `200`:

```json
{ "amount": 45000, "currency": "CZK", "variable_symbol": "0000123456", "message": "Yoga October" }
```

- `amount` is a whole number of minor units from 1 to 999999999, so `45000` is CZK 450.00. Fractions, exponents, and strings are rejected (`400`, `field: "amount"`).
- `currency` is required and must be `CZK`. `variable_symbol` is 1–10 ASCII digits, with leading zeros kept. `message` is trimmed and omitted when blank.
- The receiving account always comes from the saved connection. `iban`, `account_number`, `tenant_id`, or a ready-made payload in the body are unknown fields (`400`).
- The payload is always `SPD*1.0*ACC:<IBAN>*AM:<amount>*CC:CZK[*X-VS:<symbol>][*MSG:<message>]`, encoded in the QR code as UTF-8. The message goes in unchanged, Czech letters included, and is limited to 60 characters (`400 message_too_long`, never shortened). `*` and `%` are rejected (`400 invalid_message`) rather than percent-encoded: `*` separates fields, and George shows escapes literally and refuses to send the payment ([verification](docs/verification/004-payment-qr.md)).
- Archived connections (`409 bank_connection_archived`), suspended (`409 tenant_not_active`), and deleted (`409 tenant_deleted`) tenants cannot generate codes. Errors from the PNG endpoint are JSON too.
- Nothing is stored and no audit event is written. Repeating a request returns the same payload and does not reserve the variable symbol. The QR is rendered in-process by [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder), black on white with a quiet zone, 8 px per module, error correction level M.
- A QR code for a real account prefills a real payment in a banking app. Pairrot does not yet track whether the payment arrives.

### Expected payments

`POST .../payment-requests` saves what a tenant expects to be paid, on which of its active bank connections, for which reference in the calling application:

```json
{
  "bank_connection_id": "<connection-id>",
  "external_id": "booking_123",
  "amount": 45000,
  "currency": "CZK",
  "variable_symbol": "2026000123",
  "message": "Yoga October",
  "description": "Reservation booking_123",
  "due_at": "2026-10-15T18:00:00+02:00"
}
```

- `external_id` (up to 200 characters) and `variable_symbol` (1–10 digits) are required. Amount, currency, symbol, and message follow the payment QR rules above. `description` (up to 1000 characters) is internal and not in the QR. `due_at` must state its offset and is stored in UTC.
- A new `external_id` returns `201` with the record, `replayed: false`, and `payment_instructions` (account, payment fields, `format`, `generator_version`, and the SPAYD `payload`). Repeating the same creation returns the current record with `200` and `replayed: true`, also after later edits or cancellation; it never reopens anything. The same `external_id` with different original input returns `409 external_id_conflict`. The comparison uses a SHA-256 fingerprint of the original validated input, so omitted and `null` optional fields are equal, but `000123` and `123` are not.
- Variable symbols are unique per bank connection with leading zeros ignored: `123` and `000123` collide (`409 variable_symbol_conflict`), cancelled requests included. The same symbol on another account is allowed. Symbols are never generated or reused.
- The account number, IBAN, and payload are saved at creation and never regenerated. `GET .../{id}/payment-instructions` and `GET .../{id}/qr.png` return them (`Cache-Control: no-store`) only while the request is open, its bank connection is active, and its tenant is active; otherwise `409 payment_request_cancelled`, `bank_connection_archived`, `tenant_not_active`, or `tenant_deleted`. Archiving a connection does not cancel its requests.
- `GET .../{id}` returns an `ETag` with the record's `version`. `PATCH` changes only `description` and `due_at` of an open request; other fields are `400 immutable_field`. `PATCH` and `POST .../cancel` (optional `reason`) need `If-Match: "<version>"`: missing is `428 precondition_required`, outdated is `412 precondition_failed`. Cancelling a cancelled request is a no-op and needs no version. Nothing is ever deleted or reopened.
- `status` is `open` or `cancelled`. `is_overdue` is computed for an open request past `due_at` and never changes the status. `paid_amount` is always 0 and `remaining_amount` is the amount, or `null` once cancelled, until payment matching exists.
- `GET .../payment-requests` lists newest first, 50 per page (`limit` up to 200, `cursor` = `next_cursor`), with optional `external_id`, `status`, `bank_connection_id`, `variable_symbol` (compared without leading zeros), and `overdue=true|false` filters.
- A parent can read a suspended or deleted child's requests for history; creating, editing, cancelling, and payment instructions need an active tenant. Creation, edits, and cancellation write `payment_request.*` audit events in the same transaction; reads do not. The standalone payment QR endpoints above still save nothing.

## Administrative CLI

Root tenants, their keys, and user accounts are managed from the command line, never over HTTP. There is no public signup, invitation flow, or emailed password reset.

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- migrate
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- setup [--name <name>] [--contact-email <email>] [--admin-email <email>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys list
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys issue --purpose tenant|management [--label <label>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys revoke <key-id>

dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users list
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users create --email <email> [--tenant <tenant>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users grant --email <email> --tenant <tenant>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users revoke --email <email> --tenant <tenant>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users disable --email <email>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users enable --email <email>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users reset-password --email <email>
```

All commands accept `--operator <name>`, which is recorded in the audit log. `setup` and the `keys` commands also accept `--root <external-id>` (default `nalekci.cz`). A `<tenant>` is a tenant ID, a root external ID (`nalekci.cz`), or `root/child` (`nalekci.cz/studio_123`).

Passwords are prompted without echo, or read as one line from standard input when it is redirected. They are never printed or logged.

You can run `setup` again safely. It never creates a second root tenant, never changes an existing one, never replaces keys, and never resets an existing administrator's password. Disabling a user or resetting their password revokes all their sessions, but not the tenant's API keys.

## Database migrations

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/Pairrot.Infrastructure --output-dir Persistence/Migrations
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- migrate
```

The tenant tables mirror [docs/features/001-tenants-schema.sql](docs/features/001-tenants-schema.sql), including its check constraints and unique indexes. Feature 2 adds these tables:

- `users` (ASP.NET Core Identity storage)
- `tenant_memberships`
- `user_sessions`
- `user_audit_events`
- `data_protection_keys`

Feature 2 also gives audit events a user actor, with exactly one actor per event. Feature 3 adds `bank_connections` and records connection creation, label changes, address assignment, and archiving in `tenant_audit_events`. Feature 5 adds `payment_requests`. Its composite foreign key `(tenant_id, bank_connection_id)` references `bank_connections (tenant_id, id)`, so a request cannot point at another tenant's account. Unique indexes cover `(tenant_id, external_id)` and `(bank_connection_id, variable_symbol_key)`, and check constraints cover the amount range, currency, symbol format, state, and cancellation timestamps.

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Integration tests start their own PostgreSQL container through Testcontainers, so Docker must be running. They do not use the development database. Browser flows are tested over HTTPS with a cookie container, the antiforgery header, and the tenant header, the same way the SPA sends them. Payment QR PNGs are decoded with ZXing.Net, which shares no code with the QRCoder renderer, and SPAYD payloads are checked against the published example with a separate reader.
