# Pairrot

Pairrot matches incoming bank payments to expected payments and reports the results to its customers. It runs as a single ASP.NET Core application that serves an API and also runs background processing. Its first customer is [NaLekci](https://nalekci.cz).

Implemented so far:

- **Feature 1: tenants, subtenants, and API access** ([spec](docs/features/001-tenants.md))
- **Feature 2: user login, sessions, and API key management** ([spec](docs/features/002-user-login-and-sessions.md))
- **Feature 3: bank configuration and an inbound email address** ([spec](docs/features/003-bank-configuration-and-inbound-address.md)), with a local stub instead of Resend

The target architecture is described in [docs/architektura.md](docs/architektura.md) (in Czech).

## Tech stack

- .NET 10, ASP.NET Core minimal APIs
- EF Core 10 with Npgsql (PostgreSQL), snake_case naming
- ASP.NET Core Identity (password storage), cookie authentication, antiforgery, Data Protection keys in PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL 17 in Docker for local development; [Neon](https://neon.tech) is the planned production database
- Vite + React + TypeScript for the local test SPA (never deployed)
- xUnit, Testcontainers

## Getting started

Prerequisites: .NET SDK 10 (see `global.json`), Docker, and Node.js 20+ for the SPA.

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL. It listens on localhost:5433 and keeps its data in a Docker volume.
docker compose up -d

# 2. Restore local tools (dotnet-ef).
dotnet tool restore

# 3. Apply migrations, create the nalekci.cz root tenant and its first administrator.
#    The tenant key and management key are printed once. Store them.
#    The administrator's password is prompted (not echoed, never logged).
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- setup --admin-email you@example.com

# 4. Run the API over HTTPS (https://localhost:7017, also http://localhost:5034).
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Api --launch-profile https
```

API-key clients (Feature 1) can use plain HTTP on port 5034. Browser sessions need HTTPS because the session cookie is `Secure`.

To change the database name, credentials, or port, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. If you change them, also update `ConnectionStrings:Pairrot` in `appsettings.Development.json`.

Example requests are in [src/Pairrot.Api/Pairrot.Api.http](src/Pairrot.Api/Pairrot.Api.http).

### Local SPA

```bash
cd web
npm install
dotnet dev-certs https --trust   # once per machine, so the browser trusts localhost
npm run cert                     # exports the ASP.NET Core dev certificate to web/.cert (git-ignored)
npm run dev                      # https://localhost:5173
```

Sign in with the administrator created by `setup` or `users create`. Vite proxies `/v1/...` to `https://localhost:7017`, so the SPA and the API share one origin; set `PAIRROT_API_URL` to proxy elsewhere. The SPA keeps the antiforgery token and one-time key secrets in memory only, never in browser storage.

## Configuration

The database connection is read from `ConnectionStrings:Pairrot` (environment variable: `ConnectionStrings__Pairrot`). Local development values are in `appsettings.Development.json`. To use Neon or any other PostgreSQL, set the environment variable; no code changes are needed:

```bash
ConnectionStrings__Pairrot="Host=<neon-host>;Database=pairrot;Username=<user>;Password=<password>;SSL Mode=Require"
```

Do not commit real credentials.

Browser sign-in settings are application configuration in the `Auth` section (for example `Auth__SessionIdleTimeout`):

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionIdleTimeout` | `00:30:00` | A session ends after this long without user activity. Requests with `X-Pairrot-Background: true` (polling) do not count as activity. |
| `SessionAbsoluteTimeout` | `08:00:00` | A session ends this long after login, even if the user stays active. |
| `LockoutMaxFailedAttempts`, `LockoutDuration` | `5`, `00:05:00` | Temporary account lockout after repeated wrong passwords. |
| `LoginRateLimitPermits`, `LoginRateLimitWindow` | `10`, `00:01:00` | Login requests allowed per client IP address and window; excess requests get `429`. |
| `PasswordMinLength` | `12` | Minimum password length. |

Notification addresses for bank connections come from the `InboundEmail` section. Only the local stub exists so far:

| Setting | Value in `appsettings.json` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Provider` | `stub` | The only supported value. The stub generates addresses; it receives no email and makes no network call. |
| `Domain` | `in.pairrot.test` | Domain of generated addresses. It must be a reserved test domain (`.test`, `.example`, `.invalid`, `.localhost`); the API does not start otherwise. |

Cookie-protection (Data Protection) keys are stored in the `data_protection_keys` table, so sessions survive restarts and work across instances that share the database.

## API overview

JSON uses snake_case fields. There are two ways to authenticate:

- **API keys** for integrations: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, format `prt_<key-id>_<secret>`. Pairrot stores only a SHA-256 hash of the secret, so a key's secret is shown only when the key is created.
- **Browser sessions** for people: email and password, then an `HttpOnly` cookie that identifies a server-side session row in PostgreSQL. The session, the user, and the membership are re-checked on every request.

If an `Authorization` header is present, only the key is checked; an invalid key never falls back to the cookie.

| Caller | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant key, or a session with the tenant selected | `GET /v1/tenant`, `GET/PATCH /v1/tenant/configuration`, `GET/POST /v1/tenant/bank-connections`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/tenant/bank-connections/{id}`, `POST /v1/tenant/bank-connections/{id}/inbound-address` |
| Management key, or a session of a root administrator with `can_create_subtenants` | `POST/GET /v1/subtenants`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/subtenants/{id}`, `GET/POST /v1/subtenants/{id}/api-keys`, `DELETE /v1/subtenants/{id}/api-keys/{keyId}`, and the same bank connection routes under `/v1/subtenants/{id}/bank-connections` |
| Session only | `GET/POST /v1/tenant/api-keys`, `DELETE /v1/tenant/api-keys/{id}`, `GET /v1/tenant/audit-events`, `GET /v1/subtenants/{id}/audit-events` |
| Sign-in and session | `GET /v1/auth/antiforgery`, `POST /v1/auth/login`, `GET /v1/auth/session`, `POST /v1/auth/select-tenant`, `POST /v1/auth/logout`, `POST /v1/auth/logout-all`, `POST /v1/auth/change-password` |

Browser requests carry two extra headers:

- `X-XSRF-TOKEN` is required on login and on every cookie-authenticated `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. Get it from `GET /v1/auth/antiforgery`, and get a new one after login and after logout.
- `X-Pairrot-Tenant-Id` is the tenant the page is showing. It is required on tenant-scoped browser requests. If the session has switched to another tenant, for example in another tab, the request fails with `409 tenant_context_changed` instead of acting on the wrong tenant.

Errors use the format `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}` with the statuses 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, and 429. Validation errors about one request field also include `"field"`, so a form can show the error next to that input. Unauthenticated browser requests get a `401` JSON response, never a redirect. A resource that exists but belongs to another tenant returns the same 404 as an unknown identifier. The full contracts are in the specs for [Feature 1](docs/features/001-tenants.md#4-api-contract), [Feature 2](docs/features/002-user-login-and-sessions.md#6-api-additions), and [Feature 3](docs/features/003-bank-configuration-and-inbound-address.md#6-api-additions-and-permissions).

### Bank connections

A bank connection is a Czech CZK account that belongs to one tenant for its whole life. Root tenants and subtenants use the same endpoints. Create one with `account_number` (`[prefix-]number/bank_code`, e.g. `19-2000145399/0800`), `iban`, or both, plus an optional `label`. The API checks the format and the check digits (CNB mod-11 and IBAN mod-97) and returns both forms. This does not prove that the account exists or who owns it.

- The IBAN is the account's identity. One account can belong to only one connection in the whole system, archived ones included. Another tenant's account gets a generic `409 account_unavailable`.
- Only the label can be changed. `DELETE` archives a connection and keeps its details and address.
- `POST .../inbound-address` assigns an address such as `p_<random>@in.pairrot.test` once. Retries and concurrent requests return the same address. `address_status` is only ever `not_created` or `stub_created`. No bank email is received yet, so do not configure these addresses in internet banking.
- A parent can inspect a suspended child's connections but cannot change them. A deleted child's connections are kept read-only for history.

## Administrative CLI

Root tenants, their keys, and user accounts are managed from the command line, never over HTTP. There is no public signup, invitation flow, or emailed password reset.

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- migrate
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- setup [--name <name>] [--contact-email <email>] [--admin-email <email>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys list
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys issue --purpose tenant|management [--label <label>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- keys revoke <key-id>

dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users list
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users create --email <email> [--tenant <tenant>]
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users grant --email <email> --tenant <tenant>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users revoke --email <email> --tenant <tenant>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users disable --email <email>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users enable --email <email>
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- users reset-password --email <email>
```

All commands accept `--operator <name>`, which is recorded in the audit log. `setup` and the `keys` commands also accept `--root <external-id>` (default `nalekci.cz`). A `<tenant>` is a tenant ID, a root external ID (`nalekci.cz`), or `root/child` (`nalekci.cz/studio_123`).

Passwords are prompted without echo, or read as one line from standard input when it is redirected. They are never printed or logged.

You can run `setup` again safely. It never creates a second root tenant, never changes an existing one, never replaces keys, and never resets an existing administrator's password. Disabling a user or resetting their password revokes all their sessions, but not the tenant's API keys.

## Database migrations

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/Pairrot.Infrastructure --output-dir Persistence/Migrations
dotnet run --project src/Pairrot.Admin -- migrate
```

The tenant tables mirror [docs/features/001-tenants-schema.sql](docs/features/001-tenants-schema.sql), including its check constraints and unique indexes. Feature 2 adds these tables:

- `users` (ASP.NET Core Identity storage)
- `tenant_memberships`
- `user_sessions`
- `user_audit_events`
- `data_protection_keys`

Feature 2 also gives audit events a user actor, with exactly one actor per event. Feature 3 adds `bank_connections` and records connection creation, label changes, address assignment, and archiving in `tenant_audit_events`.

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Integration tests start their own PostgreSQL container through Testcontainers, so Docker must be running. They do not use the development database. Browser flows are tested over HTTPS with a cookie container, the antiforgery header, and the tenant header, the same way the SPA sends them.
